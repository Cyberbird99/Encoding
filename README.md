Text encoding is the process of converting human-readable characters
into a machine-readable format.

Base64 is a binary to a text encoding scheme that represents binary data 
in an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) string format

Key Features:

Error Handling:

Ensures invalid base64 strings during decoding do not crash the program.
Handles encoding/decoding exceptions gracefully with user-friendly messages.

Flexible Input:

Accepts E/e for encoding and D/d for decoding, making it more user-friendly.

UTF-8 Encoding:

Ensures compatibility with a wide range of characters and avoids potential encoding issues.

Modular Design:

Encapsulated logic makes the program easy to maintain and extend.
